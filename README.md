I realized this project after learning how to use tailwindcss. It was very challenging and fun. 
Apart from tailwindcss, I've also used JQUERY to manipulate elements on the page and IndexeedDB as database to store recipes.
Through this project, I've learnt a lots of things and I'm ready for the high level !
